                            What Is Deep Tissue Massage?
                        </h2>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Deep tissue massage uses firm pressure and slow strokes to reach deeper layers of muscle and fascia (the connective tissue surrounding muscles). It’s used to treat chronic aches and pain, as well as contracted areas such as a stiff neck and upper back, low back pain, leg muscle tightness, and myofascial release. <a href="https://dtcms.com.au/deep-tissue-massage/">Deep tissue massage therapy</a> is similar to Swedish massage, but the deeper pressure is beneficial in releasing chronic muscle tension. A National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health study found that deep tissue massage relieves pain and improves function in people with chronic low back pain.

                    Deep tissue massage techniques are often used during a full-body massage but can also target specific areas of tension. When a deep tissue massage is applied, the therapist will use slow, deliberate strokes that focus pressure on layers of muscles, tendons, or other tissues deep under your skin. This type of massage may cause some discomfort due to the intensity of the pressure. However, you should always communicate with your therapist about the stress level you’re comfortable with.

This can lead to improved circulation, reduced inflammation, and increased mobility. If you’re looking for deep tissue massage therapy in Toronto, many qualified therapists can choose from it.

                            Now that we’ve answered the question “what is deep tissue massage,” let’s look at who it’s right for. While deep tissue massage can be helpful for anyone dealing with muscle pain or tension, it’s not suitable for everyone. If you have any chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, be sure to consult with your doctor before receiving a massage. The same goes if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have bruises, open cuts, or broken bones, you should also avoid deep tissue massage until your injuries heal.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    The same goes for people who are taking blood thinners or have bleeding disorders. If you have concerns about whether deep tissue massage is proper for you, be sure to speak with your doctor or a qualified massage therapist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deep tissue massage can relieve pain and tension for people who have arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and sciatica. It can also help heal sports injuries and chronic pain related to overuse. If you have any of these conditions, deep tissue massage may be able to provide you with some much-needed relief.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deep tissue massage is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding people who have chronic medical conditions or are taking blood thinners. If you have concerns about whether deep tissue massage is proper for you, be sure to speak with your doctor or a qualified massage therapist.
